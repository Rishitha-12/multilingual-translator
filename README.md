🌐 Multilingual Translator Web App

This is a simple, elegant, and colorful web-based multilingual translator built using Flask (a Python web framework) and the Google Translate API. It allows users to input any text, detects the source language automatically, and translates the text into a selected language. It also keeps a record of past translations for user reference.
